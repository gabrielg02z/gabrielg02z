- 👋 Hi, I’m @gabrielg02z
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about coding in general, but more specifically JavaScript, React, Node, etc. I'm familiar with HTML and CSS, but have decided to try a career in IT (specifically Software Development) as I have had few life changes recently.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can help me grow and learn.
- 📫 You can email me to gabriel.gutierrez1985@gmail.com
